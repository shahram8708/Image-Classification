# Image Classification Tool

## Overview

The Image Classification Tool is a web-based application that leverages advanced AI technology to classify images. This tool is designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive experience for understanding the contents of their images. Utilizing a state-of-the-art image classification model, the tool quickly and accurately identifies objects within images and displays the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool features a clean, modern design with intuitive navigation and clear instructions.
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Advanced AI technology ensures high accuracy in image classification.
- **Real-Time Results**: Get instant classification results as soon as you upload an image.
- **Interactive Design**: The tool includes interactive elements like hover effects and responsive design for an enhanced user experience.

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Access the Tool**: Open the Image Classification Tool in your web browser.
2. **Select an Image**: Click on the "Select an Image" button. This will open a file dialog where you can choose an image file from your device.
3. **Upload the Image**: Select the desired image file. The image will be displayed on the screen once it's uploaded.
4. **View Results**: Wait for a few seconds while the AI processes the image. The classification results will appear below the image, showing the identified objects and their respective confidence levels.

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow.js with the MobileNet model

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following key files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the web application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the image upload, display, and classification logic.

### Code Explanation

#### HTML

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure of the application. It includes elements for the file input, image display, and results display. The input is hidden, and a styled label is used as a button for selecting images.

#### CSS

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the application. It uses a modern, professional color scheme and includes hover effects for interactive elements. The layout is responsive, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.

#### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the core functionality:
- **Image Upload**: When an image is selected, it is read using `FileReader` and displayed on the page.
- **Image Classification**: The `mobilenet` model from TensorFlow.js is used to classify the uploaded image. The results are then displayed below the image.

### How to Run

To run the Image Classification Tool locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shahram8708/Image-Classification.git
    ```
2. **Open the HTML File**: Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser.
    ```bash
    cd image-classification-tool
    open index.html
    ```
3. **Use the Tool**: Follow the instructions on the page to upload an image and view the classification results.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Models**: Incorporate more advanced models for even higher accuracy.
- **Mobile Support**: Optimize the design further for mobile devices.
- **Result Visualization**: Add visual elements like bounding boxes to highlight classified objects in the image.
